# DSAProject2
Final Project in DSA I @ The Cooper Union
In this project we were tasked with sorting four different types of data similar to the four columns in sample.txt
I ended up using insertion sort for the first collumn and variations of radix sort for the next three.
I was the 4th to fastest in a class of about 50 students. The grade was based solely on speed, I got a 97
